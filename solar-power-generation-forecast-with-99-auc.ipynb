In the early morning, when the sun is still rising, it’s essentially at its lowest point in the sky. In order for the sunlight to reach your panels at this time of the day, it has to cut through the most amount of atmosphere. This is important to note, because energy from the sun is absorbed when it travels through the atmosphere. So, this means that the more atmosphere it travels through, the more energy is absorbed and the less that is available for your panels to convert into electricity. At midday, when the sun is directly overhead, sunlight doesn’t need to travel through as much atmosphere. Therefore, your panels will absorb more sunlight during this time.\n","\n","- In winter, the same concept applies. However, on gloomier winter days there may be less sunlight for your panels to absorb. \n","- This can simply be explained by the sun being positioned lower in the sky than it is during summer.

Also, we can refer to it as inverter power consumption at no load condition.\n","\n","- Hence, inverter efficiency = pac/pdc where pac refers to ac output power in watt and pdc refers to dc input power in watts.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://www.inverter.com/images/uploaded/inverter-output-power-efficiency-diagram.jpg\" alt=\"Solar Panel\" width=\"90%\">\n","</center>\n","\n","> For the two basic inverters types in the market, the typical efficiency of high-quality pure sine wave inverter varied from 90% to 95% and for low quality modified sine wave inverter, it varied from 75% to 85%.\n","\n","> This power inverter efficiency value depends on inverter load power capacity variation, as the efficiency increases and may reach to its max value at higher load power capacity in compare to lower loading power capacity, and in condition that not going above inverter output power capacity limit. Generally, below 15% inverter loading, the efficiency will be quite low. Consequently, good matching between inverter capacity and its load capacity will enable us harvest larger efficiency, which means larger inverter ac output power for the same dc input power.\n","\n","[REFERENCE: ](https://www.inverter.com/what-is-inverter-efficiency)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<h1 style=\"text-align: justify; font-family: 'Lucida Calligraphy'; font-size:30px; color:#e90045\">Solar Power Prediction</h1>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-02T15:22:08.867082Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-02T15:22:08.866468Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-02T15:22:08.879858Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-08-02T15:22:08.878445Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-08-02T15:22:08.867043Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["df2 = df_solar.copy()\n","X = df2[['DAILY_YIELD','TOTAL_YIELD','AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE','MODULE_TEMPERATURE','IRRADIATION','DC_POWER']]\n","y = df2['AC_POWER']"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-02T15:22:08.881973Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-02T15:22:08.881214Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-02T15:22:08.896986Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-08-02T15:22:08.895768Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-08-02T15:22:08.881934Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["X.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-02T15:22:08.901399Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-02T15:22:08.900893Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-02T15:22:08.909923Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-08-02T15:22:08.908999Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-08-02T15:22:08.90135Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["y.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-02T15:22:08.911794Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-02T15:22:08.911268Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-02T15:22:08.994393Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-08-02T15:22:08.993228Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-08-02T15:22:08.911763Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(X,y,test_size=.2,random_state=21)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\n","             color:Black;\n","             font-size:25px;\n","             text-align:center;\n","             border-radius:30px 80px;\n","             font-weight:bold;\n","             border:2px solid red;\n","             padding:0px 20px;\">1.
